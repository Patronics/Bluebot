# Bluebot

This is a project based on my work for [Sierra College's Robotics Club's Firefighter project](https://github.com/Patronics/SierraRoboticsFireFighter), to allow a project with a firefighter-like form factor, but direct remote control with a Raspberry Pi Zero W, using Flask for the web server, and communicating to the PICAXE chip over i2c.
