# SierraRoboticsFireFighter

This is a project by Sierra College Robotics Club to make a firefighting robot, which was entered in RoboGames 2018, where it won 2nd place in the competition. 

It is under continued development, to prepare it for future competitions and improve it's performance and reliability. 

The revisions in progress as of Fall 2018 include designing a purpose-built PCB, a major hardware upgrade, and a comprehensive overhaul of the code. This is a work in progress, and expected to continue into spring 2019.
