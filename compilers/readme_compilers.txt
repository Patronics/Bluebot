If you want to compile and upload programs without the use of a GUI such as AXEPad or Programming Editor 6, you will need to install the PICAXE standalone compilers from http://www.picaxe.com/Software/Drivers/PICAXE-Compilers/ then move or copy the contents of that folder into the "c" subfolder.

You can then invoke the compiler using "make compile" or "make syntax" from the terminal.
